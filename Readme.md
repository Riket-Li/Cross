 **mb_angle.c** is the file from *MB-System* and modified the *mb_beaudoin* function to "**Cross**" algorithm. If one wants to test the algorithm, copy the corresponding code to specific position.



**Boundary** directory contains the file to calculate the boundary angle using attitude and mounting angles at transmit and receive, and tilt angle of transmit sector. The result is the two boundary angle in the case of intersection between transmit and receive cones.
